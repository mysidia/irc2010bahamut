See the INSTALL document for info on configuring and compiling
Bahamut.

THIS IS A BETA RELEASE.  NOT ALL BUGS HAVE BEEN IRONED OUT.

DEBUGGING MODE: if you run ircd with the -s flag, it will send
errors that are normally syslogged to stderr.  This is very useful
if you don't have syslogging set up and ircd won't run.
