HOW TO BUILD:
-------------
As of hybrid-4, the distribution uses gnu autoconf instead of the old
Config script.  The Makefile has also been updated to include CFLAGS
defines for popular modern OSes.

You now have two choices in how you will go about configuring and
installing your new IRCd.

Choice One: The Easy way.

1. Run the ./config script.
2. Look over include/config.h to make sure everything is set as you like.
3. Make
4. Make install

Choice Two: The Hard way.

1.  Run the configure script.  It will setup include/setup.h and the
Makefiles to match your system:
	./configure

2.  Edit the top level Makefile.  You WILL need to modify the CFLAGS.
If you want "make install" to work, be sure to change IRCDDIR.

3.  Edit the the "include/config.h" file.  This allows you to change
various options of how the ircd will operate.  Notes: "HARD_FDLIMIT_"
and "INIT_MAXCLIENTS" must be less than the maximum file descriptors
per process allowed by your kernel, and must be <= FD_SETSIZE (usually
defined in system includes, but may need to overridden in the Makefile.
Note that the old OS definitions are gone, autoconf handles this now.
Finally set the various PATH's to where you are going to stick this stuff.

4.  "make" should build ircd.

5.  "make install" should sorta work now if you defined the IRCDDIR
in the Makefile.


Best of luck!
