- Not complete
* Complete

Features:
* See bans regardless (/mode #ch b)
   Already covered in Hybrid - Raistlin
* AWAY propogation (we may want to change this in some way, its a waste of
  bw/mem in alot of cases.
   Most already in hybrid, just a few changes about how it is propogated
   when a client does /away - Raistlin
* /part comments.
   Done.  Easy code in m_part.  Needs multi server testing - Raistlin
* temp K:lines
   Covered much nicer then ours in hybrid
* show +i users on /who for opers
   Added code to do this, see CVS not about who - Raistlin
* addresses in kill messages - cosmetic
   Changes to s_user.c Nothing big - Raistlin
* Quit: before quit message
   This code was so easy I couldnt help it - Raistlin
* allow list of nicks for /kill
   See CVS comment on my commit of it.  Version 1.6
* Q:lines
   Most of the code came from old server, but I reworked it
   I removed little q's from the conf file as they break the net
   and arent used anyways - Raistlin
* U:lines
   Not really tested, but they display right.  Should handle all cases
   that dalnet ircd handles for U, and perhaps some more like clients on U
   line servers join through bans and stuff - Raistlin
* invite through anything
   This was a breeze.  We do not allow invite through +k though - Raistlin
* flags seperated (aclient->umodes, aclient->flags)
   This wasnt TOO bad.. Mostly tedious work.  See my commit comments
   for info on adding usermodes - Raistlin
* umode k - server kills
   Already in hybrid
* umode c - client connects
   Already in hybrid
* /chanserv, /nickserv, /memoserv, /operserv, /identify, /services (more?)
   Done. Added SERVICES_NAME to config.h in ./include, and basically
   ported over all of taz's alias code. -mjs 
* Globops
   Not TOO bad..  First code of mine adding a server<-->server or user
   command to the ircd. - Raistlin
   Amended to allow servers to also globop. -mjs
   Amended to prevent regular users from seeing any GLOBOPS when
   !IsAnOper, like in df465. -mjs
* locops
   Simple once the globop code above (+g) was added. -mjs
* GOPER
   Small change to sendto_ops (looks for IsAnOper, same way as in df465) -mjs
* restart/die password protection 
   Adds Xline to ircd.conf. crypt() to come later. -mjs 
* umode b / Chatops
   Code is almost exactly like globops.  Easy once it was in - Raistlin
* GNOTICE
   No oper flags -- just added GNOTICE to send.c, did includes, and added
   m_gnotice to s_serv.c. Restricted to IsServer. -mjs
* Protocol
   Started Protocol change workarounds.  See Cvs Comment. - Raistlin
* Protocol
   Cleaned up netburst to df servers - Raistlin
* notice/msg @#channel
   Fairly easy.  Improved on design and added +#channel
* Protocol
   We have base level compatibility - Raistlin
   Also added a CAPAB so we can communicate what we support.  At this time
   Only TS3 is a supported CAPAB option - Raistlin
* SVS* patches
   Most of these came right out of df.  With few changes that seemed
   to make sense.  Only thing we don't have yet is svsmode +l which
   synchronizes max user count over the network - Raistlin
* dfhybrid should honor servicestamps in respect to dfhybrid AND df
   servers - Raistlin
* umode f - flood stuff 
   I don't know what the hell I just did???? - darken 
* Z: lines
   Were basically the same thing as D lines in current hybrid.  Just fixed
   to have the correct name
   - Raistlin
* operflags
   Done with all existing oper flags.
   Trivial.  samode isn't used for anything yet but a pretty whois tho
   - Raistlin
* umode A - cosmetic
   Done with oper flags.  Not used for anything but a whois display
   - Raistlin
* umode a - more samode
   Done with oper gflags.  Not used for anything but whois.  samode needs
   to be done yet.  WD expressed an intrest
   - Raistlin
* SAMODE
   Completed what was left to do for SAMODE (msg.h, channel.c). Also
   changed set_mode() so that IsSAdmin() would be able to remove a -k 
   without knowing the key. Should be safe since an SAdmin can only send a
   mode using SAMODE, therefore avoiding the bulky mess of code from
   before. Also disabled the "crypt oper password" default. -mjs
* IP address hiding for server protection.
   Used mostly HIDEME in instances of get_client_name(). Otherwise,
   protected stats c, l, /trace, initial login, etc, from showing IP
   address. -mjs
* Autokills
* WATCH
* Rakarra's /list patch

- socks detection
- /stats L cosmetic stuff

Wish list: (mine, add to it all of you)
* opers can see +s channels in whois
   Added this, along with +p.  Really no reason NOT to - Raistlin
   Keyed this to Admin
* [taz(~NOham4us@tnt1-26.colint.com)] An extra (char *) for each user that
   shows up in whois [12:58am] - Set with svsmode +x - 64 chars.
* akill reasons (I have a patch for this too, along with timed akills..)
* Q: line code fixed (Q:/q: separation is dumb)

- fix m_who to show a channel in host/nick other requests, ala old who.
- scratch ident (it's pretty much worthless)
- format for /zline, /kline the same
- when services are down, +a people can add network-wide autokills
- redo/rewrite/rethink the resolver code (more on this below)
- network wide propogation of all server<->server link dropped errors
	(we don't do this for max sendq, and a lot of stuff)
- Correct error given instead of "dead socket"
- Merge Akills and klines to one command(?)
- network-wide Z: lines
- /mode channel +b only works if person meets any of these criteria
	a) person is an oper
	b) person is not banned on channel
